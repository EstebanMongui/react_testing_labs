# Testing Laboratory

This is a  project that contains some front-end testing cases.

Each repository's branch has a descriptive guide and documented process to follow and learn about different testing methods, tools and practices.


## Testing introduction

Testing is a process across business' teams could prove and guarantee the result of processes and its quality standards, there are different forms to test like manual tests, semi-automated tests or automated tests. The important thing here is what we need to test and the business context.
 
Specifically into the software industry, we have different kinds and testing methods in different levels, there are some of them:

- Static tests
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- E2E (End to end) testing
 
Those are the base testing proves, but it depends on the business and teams to implement other tests like functional testing or penetration testing (As a security method).

On this laboratory, I will include some of that kind of tests, you could find different proofs and laboratories on independent branches, each one containing a specific kind of test.

## Testing tools

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)-> It's a JavaScript's testing runner, and allows integrate, set up and develop automated tests 
* [Testing library](https://testing-library.com/) -> Allows make front end tests
* [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) -> Allows make front end tests with react specifically

## Unit testing
To desing our unit tests it is impotant to have in mind some base concepts

* Use case -> It's related to a user history or a specific part of user journey, this allow us to define the context of our group of tests

* Mock -> Is a "simulation" of a dependency or specific app's module

Also, there are some useful tools
